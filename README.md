Basic, summary notes from a number of courses I took during my undergraduate
degree.  

These are notes that are relevant for an entry-level software engineering
position.

Entry-level means a position that is hiring recent graduates into a general
software engineeing position. Of course, if one is looking at a specific role or
area such as firmware development or web development, other courses would be
relevant also.

The courses are:

-   Introduction to Programming

-   Algorithms & Data Structures

-   Software Engineering

-   Information Management II

-   Advanced Telecommunications

Note that these notes have not been proofread.
